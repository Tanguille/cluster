# Cluster

Welcome to my fluxcd kubernetes cluster running on talos. This is based on the [cluster-template](https://github.com/onedr0p/cluster-template) project where I want to express my gratitude to the community for all the amazing work they have done.

## üõ†Ô∏è Talos and Kubernetes Maintenance

### ‚öôÔ∏è Updating Talos node configuration

> [!TIP]
> Ensure you have updated `talconfig.yaml` and any patches with your updated configuration. In some cases you **not only need to apply the configuration but also upgrade talos** to apply new configuration.

```sh
# (Re)generate the Talos config
task talos:generate-config
# Apply the config to the node
task talos:apply-node IP=? MODE=?
# e.g. task talos:apply-node IP=10.10.10.10 MODE=auto
```

### ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Updating Talos and Kubernetes versions

> [!TIP]
> Ensure the `talosVersion` and `kubernetesVersion` in `talenv.yaml` are up-to-date with the version you wish to upgrade to.

```sh
# Upgrade node to a newer Talos version
task talos:upgrade-node IP=?
# e.g. task talos:upgrade-node IP=10.10.10.10
```

```sh
# Upgrade cluster to a newer Kubernetes version
task talos:upgrade-k8s
# e.g. task talos:upgrade-k8s
```

## üêõ Debugging

Below is a general guide on trying to debug an issue with an resource or application. For example, if a workload/resource is not showing up or a pod has started but in a `CrashLoopBackOff` or `Pending` state. These steps do not include a way to fix the problem as the problem could be one of many different things.

1. Check if the Flux resources are up-to-date and in a ready state:

    üìç _Run `task reconcile` to force Flux to sync your Git repository state_

    ```sh
    flux get sources oci -A
    flux get sources git -A
    flux get ks -A
    ```

2. Then check all the Flux Helm Releases and verify they are healthy.

    ```sh
    flux get hr -A
    ```

3. Do you see the pod of the workload you are debugging:

    ```sh
    kubectl -n <namespace> get pods -o wide
    ```

4. Check the logs of the pod if its there:

    ```sh
    kubectl -n <namespace> logs <pod-name> -f
    ```

5. If a resource exists try to describe it to see what problems it might have:

    ```sh
    kubectl -n <namespace> describe <resource> <name>
    ```

6. Check the namespace events:

    ```sh
    kubectl -n <namespace> get events --sort-by='.metadata.creationTimestamp'
    ```

Resolving problems that you have could take some tweaking of your YAML manifests in order to get things working, other times it could be a external factor like permissions on NFS.

## ‚ùî What's next

The cluster is your oyster (or something like that). Below are some optional considerations you might want to review.

### Ship it

To browse or get ideas on applications people are running, community member [@whazor](https://github.com/whazor) created [Kubesearch](https://kubesearch.dev) as a creative way to search Flux HelmReleases across Github and Gitlab.

### DNS

Instead of using [k8s_gateway](https://github.com/ori-edge/k8s_gateway) to provide DNS for your applications you might want to check out [external-dns](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns), it has wide support for many different providers such as [Pi-hole](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns/blob/master/docs/tutorials/pihole.md), [UniFi](https://github.com/kashalls/external-dns-unifi-webhook), [Adguard Home](https://github.com/muhlba91/external-dns-provider-adguard), [Bind](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns/blob/master/docs/tutorials/rfc2136.md) and more.

### Storage

The included CSI (openebs in local-hostpath mode) is a great start for storage but soon you might find you need more features like replicated block storage, or to connect to a NFS/SMB/iSCSI server. If you need any of those features be sure to check out the projects like [rook-ceph](https://github.com/rook/rook), [longhorn](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn), [openebs](https://github.com/openebs/openebs), [democratic-csi](https://github.com/democratic-csi/democratic-csi), [csi-driver-nfs](https://github.com/kubernetes-csi/csi-driver-nfs),
and [synology-csi](https://github.com/SynologyOpenSource/synology-csi).
